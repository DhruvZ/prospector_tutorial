# prospector_tutorial
Crash course tutorial on SED modeling, specifically with Prospector. 


Prospector (https://github.com/bd-j/prospector) is an SED modeling code that wraps FSPS stellar modeling and Dynesty dynamical nested Bayesian sampling. 
It enables flexible modeling of galaxy SEDs with several model choices and data handling functions. 
In this tutorial, I walk through the fundamentals of both SED modeling and Bayesian inference, with two example fits to show hands-on how to use Prospector 
and understand the output of Prospector.
